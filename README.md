# Whole Foods Business Analysis

## Project Summary

This repository contains a sample database creation and analysis for Whole Foods. It encompasses data collection, data cleaning, analysis and deriving business insights.
The primary tools and techniques used are:
- SQL
- Excel
- Statistical Analysis (Correlation, Hypothesis Testing, t-test)

## Project Description

As a business analyst at Whole Foods, answer the business question:

**Do healthier foods cost less?**

 

Unfortunately, the database administrators at Whole Foods will not give you access to the entire database. Based on your question and requirements, they have concatenated a single table for you to analyze. This table contains the fields that were available in the company's servers and contains all available structured information to address your business question. Use this information to develop the following:

 

Analysis Requirements

Introduce the problem and define "healthy" and "cost".
5-10 sentences
At least two credible sources (one for "healthy", one for "cost")
Answer the business question: Do healthier foods cost less?
5-10 sentences
Make sure your results are statistically significant (i.e., hypothesis testing or another means)
Provide your top three actionable insights.
5-10 sentences each
Provide at least one credible source per insight (support your insight with research).
Make sure to go beyond the numbers. Remember that aspects such as a correlation in the data may mean that Whole Foods is already taking advantage of a trend. Try to offer them something new where feasible.
 

SQL Code Requirements

Your code must use the following SQL structures at least once throughout your code.
group by / aggregation
subquery
case statement
Provide the SQL queries that led to your top three insights (.txt format). Include a USE statement and any code needed to get to your actionable insights without encountering errors. Make sure to that your code contains ample comments.
 

SQL Limits

The database administrators have limited you to read only access. You will not be able to create/drop tables or views, develop stored procedures or functions, or manipulate any data (even if it's dirty). You can, however, filter and group data as you see fit.
